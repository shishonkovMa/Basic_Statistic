However, two-sample t-test ignores important information that values in our samples are related to each other (i.e. first elements of both samples are related to the the same city). It decreases its power, the ability to detect differences, as compared with paired t-test. And in this case due to limited power two-sample t-test didn't reject null hypothesis (and most probably made type II error) while paired t-test rejected null hypothesis. We can trust the results of paired t-test in this case."
