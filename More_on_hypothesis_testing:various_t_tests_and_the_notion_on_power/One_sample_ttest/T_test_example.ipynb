Average weight of ordinary corn ear is considered to be 175 grams. The researcher want to test does new kind of corn differs from the ordinary in its weight (in either side). To do it, t-test is used. Find p-value. Enter 3 digits after the decimal point."

Researcher randomly choose 25 teachers from California and found that their average salary is $1900 above the country average with standard sample deviation equal to 5000.
